Follow the Steps To Run The Project :
1) npm i -- For installing node_modules
2) npm start -- For Starting The Server

Note : I push .env file also so that it will be easy to start the server without any hinderence but it is not a good practice to upload .env file especially when it contains sensitive data. 
For now i don't have any such sensitve information.
